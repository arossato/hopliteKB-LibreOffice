# HopliteKB-LibreOffice
LibreOffice Extension implementing the Hoplite Polytonic Greek Keyboard

To install, zip META-INF, py, Accelerators.xcu, Addons.xcu, description.xml into a zip file and rename the zip hoplitekb.oxt.  

Be sure not to include any enclosing folder in the zip file or the extension will fail to load.  

From LibreOffice, add the extension by going to Tools, Extension Manager, and clicking Add; select hoplitekb.oxt and restart LibreOffice.

Now you can add Polytonic Greek diacritics by pressing Control (or Command on Mac) and 1-9 to toggle on/off diacritics.  

The key bindings can be changed in Accelerators.xcu.
